* Multiplying square matrices using C++11 threads
  Simple algorithm to multiply two square matrices using threads.

  I used this site for the introduction to C++11 threads:
  http://solarianprogrammer.com/2011/12/16/cpp-11-thread-tutorial/

  The algorithm itself is in Cormen algorithms book and I assume
  everywhere that has a magical command to make loops run
  concurrently.

  The way to find out the number of cores available was found here:

* Compiling
  To compile the program run make. The executable is called 'matrix'.
